## About the Blog

Topics around here will probably mostly be living systems, software, org theory,
and politics, often trying to connnect two or more of those things together.
But it's a blog, so, you know... Expect general ruminations and rambling.

The perspective that ties it all together is that if you want to understand a
complex system, it's usually useful[^1] to think about it as a "living" thing.

Obviously that invites all sorts of questions about what definition of "living"
to use, what it means to "understand" a complex system, etc.  So expect a lot of
meta, and probably a lot of posts suggesting that "[abstract idea]
applies to [specific case] in [particular way]".

The origin of this perspective is that the topic I *really* love is the
evolution of cooperation.  I first got interested in it as a teenager, while
writing a paper about bees, and (as I later realized) it's been the central
question that's driven most of my "intellectual" interests ever since.

That was a long time ago[^2], and I've since come to realize that theoretical
biology, in one form or another, is the lens through which I view
pretty much everything else.  So I'm embracing that here. YMMV.

## About the Author

It me.  I'm kind of shy to begin with, and mildly paranoid online, so just
putting my real name on this is a break with personal tradition.  I write
software for a living, but I've done a bunch of other stuff too.  If you want to
know more you can always ask.

[^1]: "Useful" in the pragmatic sense of being better able to understand and
      predict its behavior. As in "all models are wrong, but some are useful."

[^2]: For context, that was a long enough time ago that the haplodiploidy
      explanation for hymenopteran eusociality was kind of new and not mentioned
      in the textbook I was using.
