I realize this is a very niche thing to wonder about, but I feel like there
should be a generic term for when a set of previously-antagonistic agents
discover a stable (Nash) equilibrium which increases both (all?) of their
aggregate consumption capability, allowing them (separately or collectively,
deliberately or accidentally) to use part of that surplus to adopt additional
behaviors which serve to prevent any disruption of that equilibrium, making it
(effectively) a cooperative equilibrium rather than a competitive one. "Baptists
and bootleggers" is the game scenario that's well known.

But this transition happens so constantly, and is such a foundational event in
the evolution of so many cooperative systems (not to mention in the evolution of
cognition!) that it seems like it should have a name.

It's not any particular kind of game, because it only applies to iterated
outcomes, and while it alters the payoff matrix it does so in a way that
benefits both parties _without_ requiring either of them to change the strategy
that brought them to the initial equilibirum.

It's not _just_ a kind of Nash equilibrium, not only because of the "increase in
aggregate resource availability" aspect, but because it's a transition that
happens _at_ a Nash equilibrium, and results in a new entropy gradient emerging
at the boundary that circumscribes all of the anatagonists plus their resource
environment, together.

It's more of a common phase transition, toward a common attractor.  Agents enter
a thermodynamic basin, and then take action to "steepen" the "walls" of that
basin either maximizing the resources flowing into that basin, or preventing
exogenous disruptions to the basin, or both.  What does one call that process
exactly?
