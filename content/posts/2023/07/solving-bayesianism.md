People think I'm joking when I say [things like this]({{< relref
"/posts/statistically-guaranteed.md" >}}) but I'm not.  This is very
serious business, as evidence by the fact that world-famous
Leverhulme-winning philosopher [Liam Bright][liam-twitter] has
collaborated with world-famous "Shit Nobody Cares About Enthusiast"
[tyrant lizard prince][rex-twitter] to make the exact same ~~joke~~
[extremely serious][turtles] observation.

[![Screenshot of two tweets. First, Liam Bright says "Solving
Bayesianism by just using the correct priors." Then tyrant lizard prince
responds "solving bayesianism by using the initial conditions of the
universe as my prior."](/images/site/2023/07/Liam-Bright-Bayesianism.png)][tweets]
