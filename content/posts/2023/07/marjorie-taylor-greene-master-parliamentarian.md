I've been observing US politics pretty carefully for a while now[^10], and I'm
struggling to find words for how hilarious and horrifying and 🍿 it is to see
McCarthy offer Greene a deal that basically ignores a delicately poised balance
of power and seniority *right at the point where (legislatively speaking) the
rubber actually hits the road!* 🤣

[CNN][NDAA-article]:

It's true that being on the conference commitee won't give her a veto all
by itself. But it's a lot of leverage, and a great opportunity to a) make
mischief and b) learn interesting and useful things about the sausage factory. I
mean can you even *imagine* Jeffries-as-Speaker letting someone from <abbr
title="Congressinal Progressive Caucus">CPC</abbr> do anything like this?  And
it's not even as if CPC are in any way radical.  CPC's posture toward leadership
is basically the same as Dem leadership's posture toward the GOP: prevent them
from implementing «Worst Policy Imaginable» by politely but firmly insisting on
«Second-Worst Policy Imaginable» instead.

Anyway, the big political realignment which became inevitable during Obama's 1st
term, and which started creeping forward in 2016, is now heading down the slippery
slope toward who the fuck knows what's going to happen, but whatever it is it's
gonna be very different from how things were before territory.

Fasten your seatbelts.

**UPDATE 2023-07-18** Oh no! Disobedience has infected the [SALT caucus][centrists].
Given that I want Dems to sweep the trifecta in 2024 no matter how useless and awful
they are, I guess I should be cheering on whatever internecine warfare the GOP is
willing to engage in. This is gonna lead to some real shit-ola policy though.
