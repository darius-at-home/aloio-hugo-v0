## LOL

Not even an hour after publishing [this]({{< ref "posts/against-rationalism">}})...

...I visited fosstodon while having lunch, and ran across this
[masterpiece][geepaw-hill] of understatement 🤣:

## And As Long As I'm Back Here

That [Emily Bender article][emily-bender] people have been raving about
is every bit as good as they say.

I also strongly recommend this [Erik Hoel post][erik-hoel], which does a great
job of explaining the "dumbish AIs are plenty dangerous enough" synthesis
between the "AIs are not smart enough to be dangerous yet" and the "AGI fast
takeoff scenarios are nonsensical" perspectives.

I have some quibbles with it, but nothing worth talking about when I'm supposed
to be packing for a trip.  And I dearly wish more people understood this part in
particular:

> So to say that a massive billion-parameter neural network is “merely” trained
> to autocomplete text is true. . . but that has absolutely no bearing on
> whether it’s dangerous, or what it’s capable of. Otherwise, we could say that
> humans aren’t dangerous because we are merely “glorified gene spreaders” or
> that brains aren’t impressive because they are just “glorified surprise
> minimizers.” The exact same reasoning is true for these AIs that demonstrate
> general intelligence off of autocompleting text.

Not only about the "Fast AIs" that are making headlines, but also about various
kinds of "Slow AIs" that we seem to have accepted as our collective overlords.
