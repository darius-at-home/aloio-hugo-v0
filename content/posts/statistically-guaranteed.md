Chait's Bayesian Priors][chait], it reminded me of this (paraphrased)
conversation I've heard now and then online:

**Ralph:** I realize my theory is incomplete and that it may not even be
possible for it to be complete, but by the Strict and Continuous Application of
Bayesian Principles I can at least minimize my error.

**Alice:** Wow that sounds really cool and useful.  How do I get started?

**Ralph:** Well you start with some propositions, and assign them probablities.
Then you make observations to measure the divergence between your proposed
outcomes and the actual observations, and use those to update the probabilities
associated with each proposition.

**Alice:** I think I can do that. How do I come up with my initial set of
propositions?

**Ralph:** Oh that's easy, you just make some observations, use those to form a
theory, and use the theory to generate your propositions.

**Alice:** ...
