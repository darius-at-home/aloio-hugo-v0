It's possible that I'm out of touch with the "normal" reality of modern SSGs and
how easy they are, but this has been a surprisingly pleasant experience.

After a pretty nominal amount of messing around I've got a website, a repo that
updates that website automatically whenever I commit to the main branch (thank
you GH Pages and Actions), a high quality full-featured theme (themes are indeed
where a lot of the action is in Hugo), and a reasonable sense of what to do when
I need to override something in the theme.  Or, heaven forbid, if I need to fork
the theme.

Slightly tempted to try out some other themes, because Congo seems particularly
full-featured and well-designed and I wonder if I just happened to choose a good
theme early without a lot of research.

Either way, a bunch of things which felt like papercuts at first were actually a
matter of learning the syntax, which is fine because the docs are good.  And
there's a lot of stuff that's fancy and helpful, but not _too_ magical.

All in all very satisfactory.
