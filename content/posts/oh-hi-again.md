## Welp

I really did have the best of intentions.  And to be fair I do have a
bunch of half-baked drafts laying around here and there.

But in classic <abbr data-title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder">ADHD</abbr> fashion this post is because I wanted to try out
css-based &lt;abbr&gt; handling (in this case stolen shamelessly from
[markodenic](https://markodenic.com/css-tips/)) and I figured what the
heck, publish that shit.

Not very happy with it though, because that's kind of a lot of CSS as
far as I'm concerned, plus I don't actually understand why you have to
have abbr itself declared `position: relative`. OTOH it does work. I
just might decide to adopt some other strategy later is all.
