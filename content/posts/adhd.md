## Are You Sure?

Oh yeah, no doubt about it.  I'm very "high functioning" by ADHD standards, but
I'm sure.  I rank high on *all* the self-tests, and hoo-boy is my personal
history littered with clues.

The whole of the story is way too personal to be public, but the short version
is that early on in the plague, I kept noticing that the #ADHD hashtag was
describing me, and eventually there was a particular post which triggered a
particular set of memories which made it super obvious, because... uh... let's
say that it was purely chemical in nature. That's when the epiphany happened.

## How Could You Possibly Not Have Known?

Hey what can I say?  Before that I just thought of myself as having an
easily-distracted and extremely novelty-seeking personality.

And to be fair, there was quite a lot of childhood trauma too, which
kind of obscured things. And then there was also a lot of
psychedelic-assisted self-directed recovery.  Which I'm proud of.

But there were also a lot of overlooked clues, some of them squarely in "holy
shit that is both hilarious and heartbreaking" territory.  Maybe I'll talk about
those at some point.

Meanwhile, there will be musings, and occasional tips and tricks.
